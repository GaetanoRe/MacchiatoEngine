# Macchiato Engine

This engine is a simple engine built in Java that is supposed to allow for game development to be 
more accessible to the low-end crowd. The mission of this engine is to do the following:

### 1. Deliver a Simple and easy to use engine
Our goal is to allow for people to create an engine that will allow for many beginners and students 
to use as their first step into game dev. It will be a simple to use GUI with modular components to 
allow for more advanced games and simple games to be made easily.

### 2. Compatibility
Another goal for this engine is wide compatibility. We want games utilizing this engine to be able to
render almost any game that is made in it. We won't shy away from adding more features like Vulcan rendering
rather than OpenGL, but one of our most important goals is compatibility.

### 3. Open to all to use and learn from
This engine is Open Source so almost anyone can contribute to the codebase and can make their own copies of it.
I have no doubt there are people out there that can make a better engine than I can since this is the first one I
built and I do not know everything it takes to make an engine. As I learn, the engine will improve and I would also
like for this engine's codebase to be utilized for learning purposes as well.

## Road Map

1) Texture Rendering
2) Application of Textures on the Physics Engine (Moving the textures and attaching them to physics objects)
3) Displaying a Demo

## Any other Questions?
